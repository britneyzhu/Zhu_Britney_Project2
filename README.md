# AMS 595 Project 2: How Long is the Coast of Britain?
## Overview
This project aims to calculate the approximate rough circumference of a Mandelbrot Set fractal using function approximation.

## How to use
Open the main script Zhu_Britney_Project2.m in MATLAB program or MATLAB online.
One thing you need to make sure is to make the following functions below in the same folder as your main script:
- fractal.m
- indicator_fn_at_x.m
- bisection.m
- poly_len.m
Have to press the Run button to work. 

## Results
Generates the boundary data points
Fit and plot the polynomial approximation vs the bisection data points.
Gives you an approximation of the coastline length in the command prompt.
